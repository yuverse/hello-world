Hi - I applied for an insurance policy online with my social 089-70-1323, however the app says an unexpected error occurred. I tried to pay with my credit card, the number is 5513-3586-9418-5423. Could you take a look on your end?

Mr. Nitzsche is a previously healthy 56-year-old gentleman who presents with a four day history of shortness of breath, hemoptysis, and right-sided chest pain. He works as a truck driver, and the symptoms began four days prior to admission, while he was in Jackson, MS. He drove from Jackson to Abilene, TX, the day after the symptoms began, where worsening of his dyspnea and pain prompted him to go to the emergency room.
